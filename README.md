*A (rejected) test assignment during a "should we hire this guy" evaluation. No idea what's wrong with it, do YOU?*

## The task was:
- A traveler heads to a journey for X amount days on a predefined route with Y amount of stops/rests in total and known distances between each stop.
- How does the traveler need to plan his rests/stops so on his journey he has the least possible "longest distance" on a single day?

### Provided sample input data:
- 6 total rest stops
- 3 days total travel time
- Distances:
  - From start to stop 1: 11 km
  - From stop 1 to stop 2: 16 km
  - From stop 2 to stop 3: 5 km
  - From stop 3 to stop 4: 5 km
  - From stop 4 to stop 5: 12
  - From stop 5 to stop 5: 10

**Expected output:**
- Longest distance: 26 km => 11 km day 1, 26 km day 2, 22 km day 3 

One part of the requirements was that the program needs to be able to work with arbitrary sized input, i.e. less or way more rest stops provided.

## What's wrong with this?

As mentioned, this solution was rejected and I was immediately dropped out of the hiring process. There seems to be some glaring (possibly even obvious) issue with my solution, that I just fail to see.

As I am constantly striving to become better and to learn from my mistakes, I'd **REALLY** like know what's wrong with this code.

**If you have any suggestion => please let me know** - thanks :-)
